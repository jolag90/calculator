# Calculator

*Calculator* is a practicing example. We will use it in other practicing examples as a kinda "backend"
and plan to build a CLI and a web interface (Phoenix, Liveview maybe). 

Stay tuned and feel free to collaborate if you too being on your track of learn programming with Elixir ;-)


## Next steps

- [ ] Calculator.CLI
