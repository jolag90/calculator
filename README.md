# Calculator

*Calculator* is a practicing example. We will use it in other practicing examples as a kinda "backend"
and plan to build a CLI and a web interface (Phoenix, Liveview maybe). 

Stay tuned and feel free to collaborate if you too being on your track of learn programming with Elixir ;-)

## Usage

For now, just check out this repository in a sibling path to your mix-project and use it in `mix.exs` in
`deps()` as a local dependency.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:calculator, path: "../calculator" }
  ]
end
```
